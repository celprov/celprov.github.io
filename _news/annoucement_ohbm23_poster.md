<b> Fantastic team got us a poster at OHBM23 in Montreal, Canada! </b>
<br>
Incredibly proud to have led a project at the BrainHack Geneva with a team talented enough to get ourselves a poster at OHBM! :tada:
In this work, we leverage the image quality metrics generated by MRIQC to predict the extent of head motion in T1w images using machine learning.
Using feature extraction, we also showed that signal-to-noise ratio is the most important feature for this prediction. 
Pass by [our poster](https://osf.io/7vqzr_v1) to get to know more about our methods and the results :wink:
