<b> I'm starting a doctoral research visit in Stanford University! &#127794; </b>
<br>
In my Ph.D., I'm essentially contributing to expand the tools that were initiated here, so it is an honor to be at the source &#128522;.
Through my stay, I hope to gain perspective around open science stakes and solutions and to expand my professional network through meaningful collaboration.
