<b> My first talk at a conference! &#128515; </b>
<br>
I will be presenting what an ideal QC workflow looks like for us, highlighting QC guidelines to improve the reliability of your study, and presenting how to leverage MRIQC and fMRIPrep to assess data quality.
Come listen to this educational if you want to implement better quality control (which is crucial for reliability!!)
I'm also looking forward to getting insights from the other presenters and discussing this important topic that I've been heavily involved in.
Thank you to the research topic organizers for putting together this important initiative and giving me the opportunity to participate!
