<b> I successfully passed my private defense! </b> :relaxed:
<br>
The committee praised my rigorous methodology, the clarity of my thesis manuscript and presentation, and my substantial contributions to the field.
Wrapping up this Ph.D. has been both a challenge and a privilege. 
These four years were filled with hard work, learning, and moments of doubt, but also excitement, discovery, and growth.
I'm proud of what I’ve accomplished and grateful for everyone who supported me along the way—now onto the final step, the public defense!
