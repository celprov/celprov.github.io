<b> I'm presenting a poster at ISMRM22 in London! </b>
<br>
Next week, I will be presenting my abstract called "Quality control and nuisance regression of fMRI, looking out where signal should not be found" at the ISMRM conference. 
Here is <a href="https://osf.io/hz52v/">the link to my abstract</a>. 
Meet me at 14:45 on Thursday 12 May at the posters session, if you have some questions, suggestions or ideas.
